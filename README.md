# allure_fail_comparison

Small prototype to extract information out of Allure test reports and create a csv of useful info.

Primary use is to extract information about the test case such as:
- Test name
- Test ID tag (Currently hardcoded for personal use)
- New fail
- Flaky test
- Last time test passed
- Failing step
- Failing step with parameters removed
